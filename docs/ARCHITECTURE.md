# Newport Resident App Architecture

## Overview
The Newport Resident App is built using Flutter and follows clean architecture principles with a focus on maintainability, testability, and scalability. The app is designed to provide residents with a seamless experience for managing their apartment-related services.

## Architecture Layers

### 1. Presentation Layer
- **UI Components**: Flutter widgets organized by feature
- **State Management**: Provider for simple state, Bloc for complex flows
- **Screen Navigation**: Named routes with arguments
- **Theme**: Centralized theme configuration
- **Localization**: Multi-language support

### 2. Business Logic Layer
- **Services**: Core business logic implementation
- **Models**: Data models and DTOs
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction
- **Use Cases**: Business logic orchestration

### 3. Data Layer
- **API Client**: REST API communication
- **Local Storage**: Secure data persistence
- **Cache Management**: Efficient data caching
- **Data Mapping**: JSON serialization/deserialization
